## functions in excel 
* functions in excel are akin to statistical functions in scipy, numpy, pandas etc. operating on arrays, matrices or rows of data usually
* `=<name of function e.g. SUM>(<cell column letter and row number e.g. A1>: <cell column letter and row number e.g. A10>)` or `=<name of function e.g. RANDARRAY>(<num rows>, <num cols>, <min random num to be generated>, <max random num to be generated>, <boolean value indicating whether to generate only integers e.g. TRUE or FALSE>)`
* selecting a cell and then inputting `=RANDARRAY(10, 10, -100, 100, FALSE)` will generate a matrix of 10 x 10 dimensions of random float numbers (since integer arg is set to false) between -100 and 100  
* copying a range of cells (vector or matrices) and then pasting the cell range where you've pasted the values to will be still highlighted from here you can still press ctrl and see what paste options you want to have happen, 
* if you want a vector or matrix of cells to remain unmoved while you scroll horizontally and/or vertically click `view -> freeze panes`
autofill iss useful for repeating sequences of  data with patterns, e.g. 

Mon then next Tues, next Wed
5, 10, then next 15, next 20, next 25, 
Mon, Wed, then next Fri, next Sun, next, Tues and so on..
* `=UNIQUE(B2:B5601)` creates a list of all the unique values in a column
* `=COUNTIF(<range>, "?")` counts the number of occurences of a unique value in a column 
* now I know that a pivot table is essentially the excel equivalent of a group by in SQL
* Type `=` the formula name and once the hint for the formula you want to use pops up press tab so you don't have to type every single letter of the formula
* `VLOOKUP` is a common formula/function used by DAs to look up values in the vertical orientation or columns. All formulas and rheir categories are grouped in the formulas tab in the app

## important shortcuts in excel
* ctrl + n
* to make widths or heights of each column or row the same select the range of columns or rows and right click one of the divider lines of these selected range of columns and row indeces, a dialog will popup indicating what value you want for the width or height then press enter
* to edit cell you can type directly into it or press f2
* ctrl + shift + arrow keys (left right down up) will select all the cells in a range of rows or columns that have values
* set goal tab
* pivot table
* You can drag across or down the bottom right corner of cell using the formula to apply the same formula to other columns or rows in the spreadsheet
* You can also double click the corner to apply the same formula for every row down

## EDA
* exploratory data analysis can be basically used to find out which features give the most insight to us when we have certain questions i.e. "what is the average price of the top 3 most common cars?", "what is the maximum or minimum population of an age group?"
* can be done sb.regplot to see the correlation between two variables/features
* df.describe to see descriptive statistics of each feature in the dataframe
* grouping to see the mean, max, count, median, sum, value of one or groups of feature/s
* using box plots to find out outliers in a feature
* what is pivoting?
* how to use pearson correlation in EDA?
* analysis of variance
* what are p-test and t-test
* a patient from Arizona, Diagnosed with Leukemia, in year 2014 can be multiple attribute that can be grouped and then aggregated
```
| state | year_diagnosed | disease | age |
| Arizona | 2014 | Leukemia | 23 |
| Arizona | 2014 | Leukemia | 25 |
| Detroit | 2015 | Depression | 16 |
| Detroit | 2015 | Depression | 27 |
| Detroit | 2015 | Depression | 30 |
| Alaska | 2008 | PTSD | 30 |
| Alaska | 2008 | PTSD | 29 |
```

this may emerge by asking a question prior: what is the mean age of patients diagnosed 2014 in the state of arizona with leukemia

and from here we write a query like `SELECT state, year_diagnosed, disease, AVG(age) AS mean_age FROM chronic_disease GROUP BY state, year_diagnosed, disease
WHERE state = 'Arizona' AND year_diagnosed = 2014 AND disease = 'Leukemia';`

to group the `year_diagnosed`, `state`, and `disease` columns representing a patient profile and aggregating all patients with these profiles to know their mean age

we can ask another broad spectrum question: what is the population of those diagnosed with the same disease, state, and year when they were diagnosed. which would mean aggregating again on the year_diagnosed, state, and disease columns and then using a count aggregator to determine the ciunt of each patient profile with these grouped columns e.g. `SELECT state, year_diagnosed, disease, AVG(age) AS mean_age FROM chronic_disease GROUP BY state, year_diagnosed, disease;`

#### we would have the following calculations for each unique pair of `datavalueunit` and `datavaluetype`
the most important ones that maybe indicate chronic disease would be the ff. :
* %, Prevalence e.g. `prevalence of gastrointestinal diabetes is 3.6%`
question: `so if I have a question "prevalence of gastrointestinal diabetes", datavaluetype of prevalence, datavalueunit of %, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "prevalence of gastrointestinal diabetes is 3.6%". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 which is 18003249`
answer: $(data value / 100) * population = estimated cases$ 



* %, Percent e.g. `Live births occurring at Baby Friendly Facilities is 3.6%`
question: `so if I have a question "live births occuring at baby facilities", datavaluetype of percent, datavalueunit of %, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "live births occuring at baby facilities is 3.6%". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 which is 18003249`
answer: To convert this percentage into a tangible number, you need: Total live births in Arizona (2015), not the total population.

Example: If Arizona had 85,000 live births in 2015, then: Births at facilities = 0.036 × 85,000 = 3,060 births. Births at facilities=0.036×85,000=3,060 births. Why not use total population? The metric is a % of births, not the general population. Most of the 18M people in Arizona (e.g., elderly, children) didn’t give birth



* %, Age-adjusted Prevalence e.g. `Current smokeless tobacco use among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6%` (ah okay so gets ko na pag age adjusted may age number sa question)
question: `so if I have a question "Current smokeless tobacco use among adults aged >= 18 years", datavaluetype of age-adjusted prevalence, datavalueunit of %, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "Current smokeless tobacco use among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6%". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 which is 18003249`
answer: Step 2: Isolate the Adult Population (18+)
Since the metric applies only to adults (≥18 years), you need:

Total adult population (not total state population). Example: If adults make up ~75% of Arizona's population (2015):

Adult population = 0.75 × 18,003,249=13,502,437 adults.



* %, Crude Prevalence e.g. `Individuals meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines for substantial health benefits among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6%`
question: `so if I have a question "Individuals meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines for substantial health benefits among adults aged >= 18", datavaluetype of crude prevalence, datavalueunit of %, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "prevalence of gastrointestinal diabetes is 3.6%". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 adults aged 18 and above which is 18003249`

The formula is straightforward:

Number of Individuals (Cases) = (Prevalence Rate / 100) * Total Population

Let's apply this to your example:

Prevalence Rate: 3.6%
Total Population (Arizona, 2015, adults aged 18 and above): 18,003,249
Calculation:

Number of Individuals = (3.6 / 100) * 18,003,249
Number of Individuals = 0.036 * 18,003,249
Number of Individuals = 648,116.964



* Number, Median e.g. `Median daily frequency of fruit consumption among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6`
question: `so if I have a question "Median daily frequency of fruit consumption among adults aged >= 18 years", datavaluetype of number, datavalueunit of median, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "Median daily frequency of fruit consumption among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 adulst aged 18 and above which is 150000 or does population have no effect in this?`

You are absolutely correct! In the case of "Median daily frequency of fruit consumption," the population size does not directly convert the median value into a tangible number of individuals consuming fruit with that frequency.

Here's why:

Median Represents the Middle Value: The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. In this context, a median of 3.6 means that if you lined up all the adults in Arizona (aged >= 18) according to their daily fruit consumption from lowest to highest, the person in the very middle would consume fruit approximately 3.6 times per day.
It Doesn't Tell You How Many People Consume Exactly 3.6 Times: The median doesn't tell you how many individuals consume fruit exactly 3.6 times a day. It's a measure of central tendency. Some people will consume more, and some will consume less.
No Direct Multiplication: Unlike prevalence (a proportion of the population affected by a condition), the median is a characteristic of the consumption behavior itself, not a count or a proportion of the population. Multiplying a median frequency by the total population wouldn't yield a meaningful number of individuals.
What the Median of 3.6 Does Tell You:

Approximately 50% of the adult population in Arizona (aged >= 18) consumes fruit 3.6 times per day or less.
Approximately 50% of the adult population in Arizona (aged >= 18) consumes fruit 3.6 times per day or more.
To get a tangible number related to fruit consumption frequency, you would need different types of data, such as:

The distribution of fruit consumption: You would need to know how many people consume fruit 0 times a day, 1 time a day, 2 times a day, 3 times a day, 4 times a day, and so on. With this distribution, you could then count the number of people falling into specific frequency ranges.
The percentage of the population consuming fruit at or above a certain frequency: For example, you might know that "20% of adults in Arizona consume fruit 5 or more times per day." Then you could multiply that percentage by the total population to get a tangible number.



* Number, Age-adjusted Mean e.g. `Average binge drinking frequency among adults aged >= 18 yeras who binge drink is 3.6`
question: `so if I have a question "binge drinking frequency among adults aged >= 18 yeras who binge drink", datavaluetype of number, datavalueunit of age-adjusted mean, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "Average binge drinking frequency among adults aged >= 18 yeras who binge drink is 3.6". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 adulst aged 18 and above which is 150000 or does population have no effect in this?`

To get a tangible number, you would need additional information:

Prevalence of Binge Drinking: You would need to know what percentage or the actual number of adults aged 18 and above in Arizona in 2015 were classified as binge drinkers.

Example: If a study showed that 20% of the 150,000 adults in Arizona were binge drinkers, then the number of binge drinkers would be 0.20 * 150,000 = 30,000.
Calculating Tangible Numbers with Prevalence:

Number of Binge Drinkers: Once you have the prevalence, you can calculate the estimated number of individuals in the target demographic who engage in binge drinking (as shown in the example above).
Total Binge Drinking Episodes: You could then estimate the total number of binge drinking episodes in that population by multiplying the number of binge drinkers by their average frequency: 30,000 binge drinkers * 3.6 episodes/period = 108,000 binge drinking episodes per period.



* Number, Mean e.g. `Average recent physically unhealthy days among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6`
question: `so if I have a question "Average recent physically unhealthy days among adults aged >= 18 years", datavaluetype of number, datavalueunit of mean, and datavalue of 3.6 which when translated would be "Average recent physically unhealthy days among adults aged >= 18 years is 3.6". How can I then convert this to a tangible number given the population of let's say the state of arizona in 2015 adulst aged 18 and above which is 150000 or does population have no effect in this?`

Here's the breakdown:

Mean as the Total Divided by the Count: An average of 3.6 physically unhealthy days means that if you summed up the total number of physically unhealthy days reported by all 150,000 adults and then divided by 150,000, you would get 3.6.

You Can Find the Total Number of Unhealthy Days: In this case, you can use the population to find the total number of physically unhealthy days experienced by the entire adult population.

Total Unhealthy Days = Average Unhealthy Days * Total Population
Total Unhealthy Days = 3.6 * 150,000
Total Unhealthy Days = 540,000

So, while you can't say that 540,000 individuals experienced 3.6 unhealthy days (because individuals experience whole numbers of days), you can say that the total burden of recent physically unhealthy days across the entire adult population of Arizona in 2015 was 540,000 days.

Why You Still Can't Get the Number of Individuals at Exactly 3.6 Days:

Average Represents a Distribution: The average is a summary statistic of a distribution. Some individuals will have had 0 unhealthy days, some 1, some 10, and so on. The average smooths out these individual differences.
Fractional Averages: An average can be a fraction (like 3.6), but an individual can only experience a whole number of days.
What the Average of 3.6 (Mean) Tells You:

The central tendency of the number of recent physically unhealthy days for this population is 3.6 days.
The total number of physically unhealthy days experienced by the entire population is estimated to be 540,000. This can be useful for understanding the overall health burden.
In summary:

Population does have an effect when you want to calculate the total number of events (in this case, unhealthy days) across the entire population, given the average rate.
Population does not directly tell you the number of individuals who experienced that exact average number of days. To know that, you would need information about the distribution of physically unhealthy days within the population.



* Number, Number e.g. `Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (stroke) is 2735`
question: `how about if a question is "Mortality from disease (stroke)", and its datavalue 2735, and datavaluetype is number, and datavalueunit is number?`

When you have a question like "Mortality from disease (stroke)" with a datavalue of 2735, a datavalueunit of "number", and a datavalueunit also as "number", the interpretation is relatively direct:

Interpretation:

The value 2735 represents the absolute number of deaths attributed to stroke within a specific population and time period.

Population Effect:

In this case, the datavalue itself is already a tangible number of individuals (the deceased). You do not need to multiply or divide this number by a broader population to understand its direct meaning.

However, the context of the population is crucial for understanding the significance of this number:

What is the population size? 2735 deaths from stroke in a population of 10,000 would be a very high mortality rate compared to 2735 deaths in a population of 1 million.
What is the time period? 2735 deaths in one year is different from 2735 deaths over a decade.
What is the geographic area? 2735 deaths in a small city has a different impact than 2735 deaths across an entire country.
What are the age demographics? Stroke mortality is generally higher in older populations.
Are there other relevant subgroups? Mortality rates might differ by sex, ethnicity, etc.
To calculate a mortality rate, you would need the population size:

Mortality Rate = (Number of Deaths / Total Population) * Multiplier (e.g., 100,000)

For example, if the 2735 deaths occurred in the adult population of Arizona (1,500,000 in your earlier example), the crude mortality rate from stroke would be:

Mortality Rate = (2735 / 1,500,000) * 100,000
Mortality Rate ≈ 182.3 deaths per 100,000 adults

This rate provides a better sense of the proportion of the population dying from stroke and allows for comparisons across different populations or time periods.

In summary:

The datavalue of 2735 directly tells you the number of deaths from stroke.
The population size is needed to calculate a mortality rate, which helps in understanding the impact of stroke mortality within that population and for comparisons. Without knowing the population size, the absolute number alone gives you the count of deaths but not the relative frequency.



* cases per 1,000, Age-adjusted Rate e.g. `age-adjusted rate of chronic liver disease mortality is 14.4 cases per 1000`
question: `how about if a question is "age-adjusted rate of chronic liver disease mortality", and its datavalue 14.4, and datavaluetype is "age-adjusted rate", and datavalueunit is "cases per 1000"?`

Age-Adjusted Rate: This means the mortality rate has been statistically adjusted to account for differences in the age distribution of the population being studied compared to a standard population. This allows for fairer comparisons of mortality rates between different groups or over time, as age is a significant factor in mortality.
14.4: This is the age-adjusted mortality rate.
Cases per 1000: This is the unit of the rate. It means that for every 1000 people in the standard population, 14.4 deaths are attributed to chronic liver disease, after accounting for age differences.
Converting to a Tangible Number for a Specific Population (Arizona, 2015, Adults >= 18 - Let's assume a population of 1,500,000 for this example):

To estimate the number of chronic liver disease deaths in the Arizona adult population in 2015, you would apply this age-adjusted rate to that population:

Convert the rate to a proportion: 14.4 cases per 1000 is equal to 14.4 / 1000 = 0.0144.

Multiply the proportion by the population size: 0.0144 * 1,500,000 = 21,600

Therefore, based on an age-adjusted mortality rate of 14.4 cases per 1000 and an estimated adult population of 1,500,000 in Arizona in 2015, we would estimate approximately 21,600 deaths due to chronic liver disease in that population, after adjusting for age.

Important Considerations:

The "Standard Population": Remember that age-adjusted rates are specific to the standard population used for adjustment. If you were comparing this rate to another region or time period, it would be important to know if they used the same standard population for their calculations.
Crude vs. Age-Adjusted: This is an age-adjusted rate. The actual (crude) mortality rate in Arizona's adult population might be higher or lower depending on the age distribution of that specific population compared to the standard population.
Specificity of the Population: The accuracy of the estimated number of deaths depends on how well the age distribution of the Arizona adult population in 2015 aligns with the age distribution of the standard population used to calculate the 14.4 per 1000 rate.

* cases per 10,000, Age-adjusted Rate e.g. `age-adjusted rate of hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as any diagnosis is 178.99 cases per 10000`
question: `how about if a question is "age-adjusted rate of hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as any diagnosis", and its datavalue 178, and datavaluetype is "age-adjusted rate", and datavalueunit is "cases per 10000"?`

Age-Adjusted Rate: As before, this mortality rate has been statistically adjusted to remove the effect of different age distributions between populations, allowing for more meaningful comparisons.
178: This is the age-adjusted mortality rate.
Cases per 10000: This is the unit of the rate. It means that for every 10,000 people in the standard population, 178 deaths are attributed to chronic liver disease, after accounting for age differences.
Converting to a Tangible Number for a Specific Population (Arizona, 2015, Adults >= 18 - assuming a population of 1,500,000):

To estimate the number of chronic liver disease deaths in the Arizona adult population in 2015 based on this rate:

Convert the rate to a proportion: 178 cases per 10,000 is equal to 178 / 10,000 = 0.0178.

Multiply the proportion by the population size: 0.0178 * 1,500,000 = 26,700

Therefore, based on an age-adjusted mortality rate of 178 cases per 10,000 and an estimated adult population of 1,500,000 in Arizona in 2015, we would estimate approximately 26,700 deaths due to chronic liver disease in that population, after adjusting for age.

Key Points to Remember:

The Standard Population: The estimated number of deaths is still influenced by how well the age structure of the Arizona population aligns with the standard population used for the age adjustment.
Rate per Different Unit: The key difference here is the unit ("per 10000" instead of "per 1000"). You need to adjust the conversion to a proportion accordingly.
Direct Estimation: Age-adjusted rates are valuable for comparing mortality risks across populations, and by applying them to a specific population, you can get an estimate of the number of deaths expected in that population, considering its size.



* cases per 100,000, Age-adjusted Rate e.g. `age-adjusted rate of mortality from total cardiovascular diseases is 206.5 cases per 100000`
question: `how about if a question is "age-adjusted rate of chronic liver disease mortality", and its datavalue 206.5, and datavaluetype is "age-adjusted rate", and datavalueunit is "cases per 100000"?`

Age-Adjusted Rate: As before, this mortality rate has been statistically adjusted to account for differences in the age distribution of the population being studied compared to a standard population.
206.5: This is the age-adjusted mortality rate.
Cases per 100000: This is the unit of the rate. It means that for every 100,000 people in the standard population, 206.5 deaths are attributed to chronic liver disease, after accounting for age differences.
Converting to a Tangible Number for a Specific Population (Philippines, 2025, Adults >= 18 - Let's assume an estimated adult population of 70,000,000 for this example, considering the current time and location):

To estimate the number of chronic liver disease deaths in the adult population of the Philippines in 2025 based on this rate:

Convert the rate to a proportion: 206.5 cases per 100,000 is equal to 206.5 / 100,000 = 0.002065.

Multiply the proportion by the population size: 0.002065 * 70,000,000 = 144,550

Therefore, based on an age-adjusted mortality rate of 206.5 cases per 100,000 and an estimated adult population of 70,000,000 in the Philippines in 2025, we would estimate approximately 144,550 deaths due to chronic liver disease in that population, after adjusting for age.

Key Points to Remember:

The Standard Population: The estimated number of deaths is still influenced by how well the age structure of the Philippines' adult population in 2025 aligns with the standard population used for the age adjustment.
Rate per Different Unit: The unit here is "per 100000". Make sure to adjust the conversion to a proportion accordingly.
Direct Estimation: Age-adjusted rates provide a standardized measure of mortality risk, and by applying them to a specific population, you can estimate the expected number of deaths for that cause, considering the population size.



* cases per 1,000,000, Age-adjusted Rate e.g. `age-adjusted rate of asthma mortality rate is 8.3 cases per 1000000`
question: `how about if a question is "age-adjusted rate of chronic liver disease mortality", and its datavalue 8.3, and datavaluetype is "age-adjusted rate", and datavalueunit is "cases per 1000000"?`

Age-Adjusted Rate: As before, this mortality rate has been statistically adjusted to remove the effect of different age distributions between populations, allowing for more meaningful comparisons.
8.3: This is the age-adjusted mortality rate.
Cases per 1000000: This is the unit of the rate. It means that for every 1,000,000 people in the standard population, 8.3 deaths are attributed to chronic liver disease, after accounting for age differences.
Converting to a Tangible Number for a Specific Population (Philippines, 2025, Adults >= 18 - assuming an estimated adult population of 70,000,000):

To estimate the number of chronic liver disease deaths in the adult population of the Philippines in 2025 based on this rate:

Convert the rate to a proportion: 8.3 cases per 1,000,000 is equal to 8.3 / 1,000,000 = 0.0000083.

Multiply the proportion by the population size: 0.0000083 * 70,000,000 = 581

Therefore, based on an age-adjusted mortality rate of 8.3 cases per 1,000,000 and an estimated adult population of 70,000,000 in the Philippines in 2025, we would estimate approximately 581 deaths due to chronic liver disease in that population, after adjusting for age.

Key Points to Remember:

The Standard Population: The estimated number of deaths is still influenced by how well the age structure of the Philippines' adult population in 2025 aligns with the standard population used for the age adjustment.

* cases per 1,000, Crude Rate e.g. `crude rate of hospitalization for heart failure among medicare-eligible persons aged >= 65 years is 16.5 cases per 1000`
question: `how about if a question is "crude rate of hospitalization for heart failure among medicare-eligible persons aged >= 65 years", and its datavalue 16.5, and datavaluetype is "crude rate", and datavalueunit is "cases per 1000"?`

Okay, let's break down the interpretation of a crude rate with a unit of "cases per 1000".

Interpretation:

Crude Rate: This means the rate is calculated based on the total number of events (hospitalizations for heart failure) occurring within the entire population of interest (Medicare-eligible persons aged >= 65 years) without any adjustment for factors like age distribution within that specific population.
16.5: This is the crude rate of hospitalization for heart failure.
Cases per 1000: This is the unit of the rate. It means that for every 1000 Medicare-eligible persons aged 65 years or older in the population, there are 16.5 hospitalizations for heart failure.
Converting to a Tangible Number for a Specific Population (Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines, 2025 - We'll need to estimate the Medicare-eligible population aged >= 65 years):

To estimate the number of hospitalizations for heart failure in the Medicare-eligible population aged 65 and above in Mandaluyong City in 2025, we need an estimate of that specific population.

Let's make a hypothetical assumption: Suppose there are approximately 20,000 Medicare-eligible persons aged 65 years or older in Mandaluyong City in 2025.

Now we can estimate the number of hospitalizations:

Convert the rate to a proportion per individual: 16.5 cases per 1000 people is equal to 16.5 / 1000 = 0.0165 hospitalizations per person.

Multiply the proportion by the specific population size: 0.0165 * 20,000 = 330

Therefore, based on a crude hospitalization rate of 16.5 cases per 1000 Medicare-eligible persons aged >= 65 years and a hypothetical population of 20,000 individuals in that demographic in Mandaluyong City in 2025, we would estimate approximately 330 hospitalizations for heart failure in that group.

Key Points to Remember:

Crude Rate Specificity: This rate applies to the entire Medicare-eligible population aged 65 and above. It doesn't account for differences in risk factors or age within that broad group.
Population Specificity: You must apply this rate to the specific population of interest (Medicare-eligible persons aged >= 65 in Mandaluyong) to get a tangible number for that location. Using the general adult population of Mandaluyong would be inaccurate as the rate is specific to the Medicare-eligible older adult group.
Data Availability: The accuracy of your estimate heavily relies on having a reasonably accurate estimate of the Medicare-eligible population aged 65 and above in Mandaluyong City for the year 2025. This kind of specific demographic data might require local government or health authority statistics.

* cases per 10,000, Crude Rate e.g. `crude rate of Emergency department visit rate for asthma is 132.33 cases per 10000`
same idea as above i.e. (132.33 / 10000) * population of those had emergency department visits
* cases per 100,000, Crude Rate e.g. `crude rate of mortality from total cardiovascular diseases is 53 cases per 100000`
* cases per 1,000,000, Crude Rate e.g. `crude rate of asthma mortality rate is 9.3 cases per 1000000`

* cases per 1,000,000, Adjusted by age, sex, race and ethnicity e.g. `cases per 1000000 of Incidence of treated end-stage renal disease attributed to diabetes adjusted by age, sex, race and ethnicity is 156.8`
* cases per 1,000,000, Number e.g. `cases per 1000000 of Incidence of treated end-stage renal disease is 1125`

*NOTE: annual is yearly*
* cases per 100,000, Average Annual Age-adjusted Rate e.g. `Average yearly age-adjusted rate of Invasive cancer (all sites combined), mortality is 11.9 cases per 100000`
same idea (11.9 / 100000) * population count = total cases in the population  

* cases per 100,000, Average Annual Crude Rate e.g. `Average yearly Crude Rate of Invasive cancer of the female breast, incidence is 13.3 cases er 100000`

* cases per 100,000, Number e.g. `mortality from heart failure is 3799 cases per 100000`
* per 100,000 residents, Number e.g. `Number of farmers markets per 100,000 residents is 7.3`

and other miscellaneous pairs would be:
* gallons, Per capita alcohol consumption e.g. per capita alchol consumption aged >= 14 years is 2.1 gallons
* pack sales per capita, Number e.g. sale of cigarette packs is 44.3 pack sales per capita
* Years, Number e.g. Life expectancy at birth is 78.2 years
* `$`, US Dollars e.g. Amount of alcohol excise tax by beverage type (wine) is 0.72$

maybe the idea now is dahil maraming questions but of same topics we need to group them according to their topic ID

* As far as I know, in order to get myself acquainted and understand the data I need to first visualize and manipulate it as best I know how using pandas and python and matplotlib
* the vague next step would now be to import the same now understood data to pgAdmin 4 so I can use pgsql to manipulate it and do data cleaning, preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering there separately without python
* I think I'll be using a series of selects and then once the final table is out I can then save it as a separate table as a .csv file
* the next is to now showcase these result in some kind of visualization platform like PowerBI
* to run scripts enter postgresql cli by running `psql -U <name of user e.g. postgres>` then enter password then enter path of `.sql` script relative to the current directory `\ir "./<name of file>.sql"`


* queries used:
1. `select "DataValueFootnote" from "ChronicDisease" where 'No data available' in ("DataValueFootnote");`
2. `select "DataValueFootnote" from "ChronicDisease" where ' ' in ("DataValueFootnote");` reveals the empty strings in the dataaluefootnote column

which is useful especially if we are troubleshooting an error in our mysql workbench that a connection has not been established because it can either be two things that causes this error: one is if the service is not started which can be solved by typing services in our search bar and in the services application find the MySql80 service and start or restart this service, if this does not work it could bev that when installing your MySql applications you changed the default port number of 3306 to another port number i.e. 3307 which we can see in our active ports clearly listed and not 3306, and now when you make another connection or server with the default port number of 3306 it fails to connect since the default port number has indeed been changed to 3307. So when we make a connection or server we must specify its port number to be the one that we picked during installation which was port 3307. And from here if we click test connection it will now ask for our root password which we also set during installation (which we also need to remember at all times) and once entered it will show that it has successfully connected to our server and from here we can create databases and tables.

* below error can be resolved by again specifying the default port number we changed earlier and the user using the -P and -u arguments respectively e.g. `mysql -P 3307 -p test_db -u root`

```
C:\Users\LARRY>mysql

* ms sql server seems to be the industry grade database management system compared to mysql or postgresql. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads we can download the express version here. This tool we will need to learn apart from ms powerbi in order to familiarize ourselves with these tools functionality from the inside out to eventually be ready to pass the certification exams like PL-300 for the power bi data analyst certification adn the DP-300 for the ms azure dtabase administrator certification

* once ms sql server is installed we copy the connection string e.g. `Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=master;Trusted_Connection=True;`. The installation location is in `C:/Program Files/Microsoft SQL Server/`

* if a `A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.) (Framework Microsoft SqlClient Data Provider)` error occurs when connecting to a server even in windows authentication chekc the `trust server certificate` option and then hit ok in dialog box

* to use ms sql server in command line we type the command `sqlcmd -S <name of laptop e.g. LAPTOP-3GL266K9\name of instance e.g SQLEXPRESS>`. Note it is imperativee that the device name and the name of the instane/server must have a backward slash in betweeen them and not a forward slash.

* we can start a windows service via command line if we run first and foremost the command prompt as administrator (to have administrative permissions of course like starting/stopping a service) and then running `net start "<name of windows service (even with spaces and with casing) e.g. SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)>"`. And if we want to stop it we run 

here once we go into the command line itnerface of ms sql server the way we execute sql queries or statements is done always after typing the `go` keyword. So every statement or query we type goes into the next line when we press the enter key and once in this line we type `go` nd hit enter again to execute the query

* So cardinality pala is yung relationship ng two or more tables like yung 1 to 1, 1 to many (many to 1), and many to many. If a column of table A has unique rows (strictly one value) and column of table B has unique rows we can say we can establish a 1 to 1 relationship between these values of these columns. If a column of table A has 1 unique value and a column of table B ohowever has more than 1 unique values then we can establish a relationship that's 1 to many or many to 1 if the direction of filter is from B to A. And if many to many then it means that a column from table A has more than 1 unique values and that column from table B has more than 1 unique values also which we can both use to establish relationships. 

* And cross filter is how you want these cardinalities to flow whether single i.e. one way from table A to table B or bidirectional meaning both the flow of cardinality can be from take A to B or vice versa

* I realized you can use sql sub queries in either two places: with the FROM keyword and with the WHERE clause using an IN condition
 
As these seem to be the only ones where we can use tables

I.e. `... FROM (<sub query>)` or `... WHERE <column> IN (<sub query)`

* online transaction processing (OLTP) is used for everyday queries made by applications to databases to maybe retrieve, insert, update, or delete data. And online analytics processing (OLAP) is where data consolidated over a long period of time and doesn't come in an everyday manner like users interacting with servers, and where complex queries are made that erhaps make aggregations on large amounts data for data analysis and business intelligence and insights.

basically OLTP is your typical application database like MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, Firebase, etc. And OLAP is basically a database but for extremely large amounst of data (a database on steroids) which is used for business intelligence and analytics and extracting insights from data, these are now what's considered your typical data warehouses like GCP Big Query, Azure Synapse, AWS Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks

* However because snowflake, aws redshift, azure synapse, databricks (since it after 2 hours you have to recreate cluster for databases to run on), and bigquery aren't free some other free OLAP alternatives could be DuckDB which is an open-source column-oriented Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to provide high performance on complex queries against large databases. Another is Apache Druid. However since connectors to powerbi for these OLAp alternatives aren't directly available we will have to download an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver for powerbi.

* Headless mode in Selenium refers to the ability to run browser automation scripts without launching a visible browser window or GUI. Instead, the browser operates in the background, performing all the actions you've programmed (navigating to pages, interacting with elements, executing JavaScript) but without displaying anything on your screen.

Think of it like this:

Headful (Normal): Selenium opens a full browser window that you can see and interact with (or watch the script interact with).
Headless: Selenium runs a browser instance in memory. You don't see a browser window, but the browser engine is still fully functional and processing the web pages.
Why use headless mode?

Speed and Efficiency: Headless browsing is generally faster and less resource-intensive because it doesn't need to render the GUI. This can significantly speed up your scraping or automation tasks.
Server Environments: Headless mode is essential for running Selenium scripts on servers or in environments where there's no graphical interface available (e.g., cloud servers, CI/CD pipelines).
Scalability: Running multiple headless browser instances in parallel is often easier on server resources than running multiple full browser instances.
Background Tasks: For tasks like web scraping or automated testing that don't require visual confirmation, running in the background is ideal.
Common Headless Browsers used with Selenium:

Chrome Headless: Chrome offers a built-in headless mode.
Firefox Headless: Firefox also has a headless mode.
In essence, when you run Selenium in headless mode, it's like having a virtual browser working silently in the background, fetching and processing web content without any visual output. This makes it a powerful tool for automated tasks that don't require a user interface.

Ah so this is similar to dockers detached mode allpwing docker to just run in the background instead of taking up control of the command line interface


That's an excellent analogy! You've बिल्कुल grasped the core concept of running something in the background without direct visual interaction.

Yes, headless mode in Selenium is very similar in principle to Docker's detached mode (-d).

Here's why the comparison works so well:

Running in the Background: Both headless Selenium and detached Docker allow a process (a browser instance or a container) to execute without actively occupying your terminal or displaying a graphical user interface.
Resource Efficiency: Both approaches are often used for efficiency. Headless Selenium consumes fewer resources than a full browser GUI, and detached Docker containers free up your command line and can run more efficiently in the background.
Automation and Server Use: Both are crucial for automation and running tasks on servers where direct interaction isn't needed or possible. You wouldn't typically run a full browser GUI on a production server for web scraping, just like you'd usually run your web application in a detached Docker container.
Control via Other Means: Just as you interact with a detached Docker container using Docker commands (docker logs, docker exec, etc.), you control a headless Selenium browser through your script, telling it which websites to visit, what actions to perform, and how to extract data.
The key difference lies in what is being run in the background:

Headless Selenium: Runs a web browser engine (like Chrome or Firefox) in memory without a visible UI. Its purpose is to interact with web pages programmatically.
Docker Detached Mode: Runs an entire isolated environment (a container) in the background. This container can house various applications, including web servers, databases, or even Selenium itself.
So, while the underlying principle of running a process in the background without direct UI interaction is the same, the nature of the process differs. You could even run a headless Selenium instance inside a detached Docker container!

Your analogy is spot-on for understanding the fundamental idea of background execution and resource management in both contexts.

* if pyspark is not yet added to our path upon installation in our environment or globally we will need to locate the bin directory inside pyspark directory and add the bin directory path to our `PATH` environment variable. Why we do this is so we can run spark-submit and other spark related commands in our command line.

* if an error 
```

```
this maybe due to dependency errors and certain values not being added to the path system environment variable or an environment variable not being added such as `SPARK_HOME`, `HADOOP_HOME`, and `JAVA_HOME` as system environment variables containing the installation location of these softwares

take note that spark 3.5.5 requires java 8 or 17 and later. When on the downloads page it will also indicate that it is prevuilt for hadoop 3.3 and later meaning we have to install hadoop 3.3.0 and later releases (but specifically the winutils.exe file and hadoop.dll files as it requires these in order to run spark in windows) and must be under these release versions.

steps for setting up apache spark from scratch locally in windows
- java development kit 17: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
- apache spark: https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
- hadoop winutils: https://github.com/kontext-tech/winutils/blob/master/hadoop-3.3.0/bin/winutils.exe
- hadoop winutils: https://github.com/kontext-tech/winutils/blob/master/hadoop-3.3.0/bin/hadoop.dll. Note that whatever spark version you download must be compatible with hadoop version e.g. if we go to with a 3.5.5 version of apache spark we check https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.5.5/pom.xml and see the the ff.
```
...
<slf4j.version>2.0.7</slf4j.version>
<log4j.version>2.20.0</log4j.version>
<!-- make sure to update IsolatedClientLoader whenever this version is changed -->
```
**`<hadoop.version>3.3.4</hadoop.version>`**
```
<!-- SPARK-41247: When updating `protobuf.version`, also need to update `protoVersion` in `SparkBuild.scala` -->
<protobuf.version>3.23.4</protobuf.version>
<protoc-jar-maven-plugin.version>3.11.4</protoc-jar-maven-plugin.version>
...
```
here it indicates that under the 3.5.5 version or branch of spark it needs the hadoop version to be 3.3.4 and so we search for hadoop with version 3.3.4 and download it specifically the `.tgz` it usually is encased in at https://hadoop.apache.org/release/3.3.4.html

- once downloaded extract the `spark-3.x.x-bin.hadoop3.tgz`
- rename the extracted folder `spark-3.x.x-bin.hadoop3` to just `spark-3.x.x`
- once jdk17 is downloaded run executable file and install JDK and keep track fo installation location which is commonly at `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17` 
- create folder named hadoop and inside it create sub directory/ named bin and move the downloaded hadoop `winutils.exe` file inside
- move the spark and hadoop folders in any directory or perhaps the `C:\Program Files` directory
- copy the `C:\Program Files\spark-3.5.5`, `C:\Program Files\hadoop`, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17` paths which contain the bin files of spark, hadoop, and jdk 17
- add new system environment variables named `SPARK_HOME`, `HADOOP_HOME`, and `JAVA_HOME`, with these values respectively. AH so now I know that you can download these software in a docker container and replicate the same process of copying their installation paths and creating system environment variables through `export JAVA_HOME="installation/dir/of/jdk"`, `export SPARK_HOME="installation/dir/of/jdk"`, `export HADOOP_HOME="installation/dir/of/hadoop"` (however note this inly does it for the current shell and all processes in current shell if you want to do it globally or add it as a system environment variable you need to use `sudo -H gedit /etc/environment`)
- in windows we can reference these system environment variables as `%<name of env var>%` e.g. `%SPARK_HOME%` and we'd get the value we assigned to this environment/system environment variable and add backslashes to it to reference sub directories in this directory e.g. `%SPARK_HOME%/bin` will be `C:\Program Files\spark-3.5.5\bin`. In linux we use `$<name of env var>`. But we add new values to the system path environment variable where we will now reference these newly created system environment variables. We add `%SPARK_HOME%\bin`, `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin`, and `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
- restart the command line and run `javac --version`, `spark-shell`, to check if the installed software has been installed and commands are able to run in command line. spark-shell is a CLI for spark. Now we can use `spark-submit` for our python scripts containing spark sessions
- we need to also add PYSPARK_HOME containing the path to our global python interpreter which would be in path `C:\Users\LARRY\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\` and appended to it the `python.exe` e.g. `C:\Users\LARRY\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe` as this string will be needed in order for `spark-submit` to run our python scripts containing spark commands
- because we will be running spark on a windows machine locally it is imperative that even if we already added the `HADOOP_HOME` system environment variable and added added `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin` containing our `hadoop.dll` and `winutils.exe` to our PATH system environment variable, we must also add the `hadoop.dll` to our `system32` folder as this will be needed in order to prevent future errors like `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError` this is because spark requires certain Hadoop binaries (particularly `winutils.exe` & `hadoop.dll`) to simulate the Hadoop environment that Spark relies on. This step is essential for enabling Spark to run properly on Windows, as these binaries help in file system operations like setting permissions configurations that are otherwise required in unix and posix systems like those that use Linux OS. This is why in a docker container/linux machien this wouldn't be the case; all these unnecessary hardwork to install spark as spark and hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) already works in synergy with linux os. Lesson learned don't try to make Spark applications for Windows unless you need to. But you can avoid the pain if you follow the above steps so maybe it's not so bad. Good luck and thanks for reading! **https://medium.com/data-engineer-things/deploying-a-spark-based-application-as-a-windows-application-4ddc88231784**

* in order to read excel files spark needs to download and then include external packages which can be run by command `spark-submit --packages com.crealytics:spark-excel_2.12:3.5.1_0.20.4 transform_us_populations_per_state_by_sex_age.py <arg name> <value>`. In order to execute this spark script it is imperative to add this packages argument as this indicates the dependency that we need installed when running this script transforming excel files

* `com.crealytics:spark-excel_2.12:3.5.1_0.20.4` is actuall ythe package we need to read these excel files using spark where `com.crealytics` is the group id, `spark-excel_2.12` is the artifact id, and `3.5.1_0.20.4` is the release version

* but how come this works when using `spark-submit` but when using jupyter notebooks the extra packages are not downloaded 

* this is why if your going to use spark with airflow or in a docker container it is better to install it globally in the container rather than as a package and then set the paths manually

* AFAIK the way to dockerize everything every dependency of this data pipeline would be to do the ff.

- extract the components of the downloaded tar.gz or .tgz file using `tar xvzf <name of compressed tar file> --directory <directory in linux/docker container you want the tar file contents to be dumped once extracted>`
- know where each package namely spark, hadoop, and jdk was installed and copy its path and use this path to set environment variables in the docker file e.g. SPARK_HOME, JAVA_HOME, PYSPARK_HOME
- somehow you're going to need to change permissions when copying, moving, and reading the files downloaded in the container so you have to learn `chmod` and other commands like it 

* `-L`, `--location` - Allow curl to follow any redirections. E.g. `curl -L https://example.com` 
* `f`, `--fail` - If the server returns an error, curl fails silently and returns error 22. e.g. `curl --fail https://example.com`
* `-o`, `--output` <file> - Store output in a file. The output is not shown in stdout. E.g. `curl -o file https://example.com -o file2 https://example.net`
* `-O`, `--remote-name`	- Specify that the local file should have the name of the remote file that was downloaded. E.g. `curl -O https://example.com/filename` otherwise we can provide our own file name using the `-o` argument
* we can combine multiple arguments in one, using only a hyphen and the letters upper or lowercase that represent a specific argument e.g. `curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.0.0/docker-compose.yaml'` means we will download a file in this location and that the local file should have this same remote files name and if it returns an error it will do so silently and return only `22`

* with the `chmod` command you can use either numeric or symbols to change permissions of a file or directory in linux
* `ls` command with argument `-l` indicates that we want to list the files in a directory with meta data such as the permission level of each user for a file or files
* there are 3 types of users, root, group, and other users
* when we see the meta data of a file using `ls -l`, it might list the ff. examples
- `---------- 1 <e.g. > <e.g. > <timestamp e.g. 24 Oct 1 22:31><name of file e.g. spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3.tgz>`
- `-rwxrwxrwx 1 <e.g. > <e.g. > <timestamp e.g. 24 Oct 1 22:31><name of file e.g. spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3.tgz>`
- `drwxr-xr-x 4 <e.g. > <e.g. > <timestamp e.g. 24 Oct 1 22:31><name of file e.g. spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3.tgz>`
as you can see the first char can either be `d` or `-` where `d` just means the listed content is a directory and a `-` is a file. The rest of the 9 chars moreover are what's more important because when we divide this into 3 groups we get exactly three divisions of `---` where each hyphen represents a permission a user can apply on a file such as read represented as `r`, write repd. as `w`, and execute repd. as `x` and each group of `---` is what represents the type of user such as root user or the admin of the system which can usually virtually have all permissions like reading, writing, and executing files where a file woudl have `-rwx------`, the grouped users, and other users in this order.
- in the numeric way of adding because there are always 3 hyphens per division or user type each hyphen can be represented as an octal number from 0 to 7. E.g. the `755` in `chmod 755` when converted to binary is 111 101 101 because 111 when converted to back to octal is 7 since $1(2*2) + 1(2*1) + 1(2*0) = 1(4) + 1(2) + 1(1) = 7$, 101 when converted back to octal is 5 since $1(2*2) + 0(2*1) + 1(2*0) = 1(4) + 0(2) + 1(1) = 5$. this means that since there are 3 binary digits each digit represents in order the read, write, and execute permissions, so if we were to have a user only have read and execute permissions we would have the binary value 101 and when converted to octal would be 5 and then this 5 we use for that specific user be it in our root,  grouped user, or other user divisions e.g.
```
[0-7]  [0-7]   [0-7]
  |      |       |
root  grouped  other  
```
when we want a user specifically a root user and the other users to have all permissions but except this root to have write only we would have a binary value 010 and when converted to octal would be 2 and when we run the command to change the permission since we want all other users to retain their permission we write 277 overall the command would be `chmod 277 <name of file or directory>`
- now for an easier way using symbolic mode we can change the permission by indicating either `u`, `g`, `o`, two of these or all of them in our chmod command. `u` represents a root user, `g` the grouped users, and `o` the other users then succeeded by a `+` char then the letters `r`, `w`, `x`, two of these, or all of them which we know represent read, write, and execute permissions. So when we write `chmod ug+rw <name of file>` we are adding read & write permissions to hte root and grouped users. When we write `chmod o+rwx` we add read, write, execute permissions to the other users

* In Docker containers, Quarto refers to using the Quarto publishing system to create static and interactive content within a Docker environment. You can utilize Docker to render Quarto documents and projects, deploy them as static websites, or host interactive web applications with backends like R Shiny. 

* if an `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: 'boolean org.apache.hadoop.io.nativeio.NativeIO$Windows.access0(java.lang.String, int)` error occurs it maybe because you don't have `hadoop.dll` inside your system32 folder

* Master URLs passed to Spark can be in one of the following formats:
- `local` - Run Spark locally with one worker thread (i.e. no parallelism at all).
- `spark://HOST:PORT` - Connect to the given Spark standalone cluster master. The port must be whichever one your master is configured to use, which is `7077` by default (which we know in airflow images is what is used).

* important configurations in spark
- `spark.driver.cores` - 1 - Number of cores to use for the driver process, only in cluster mode.	1.3.0
- `spark.driver.maxResultSize` - 1g - Limit of total size of serialized results of all partitions for each Spark action (e.g. collect) in bytes. Should be at least 1M, or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total size is above this limit. Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from out-of-memory errors.	1.2.0
- `spark.driver.memory` - 1g - Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized, in the same format as JVM memory strings with a size unit suffix ("k", "m", "g" or "t") (e.g. 512m, 2g).
Note: In client mode, this config must not be set through the SparkConf directly in your application, because the driver JVM has already started at that point. Instead, please set this through the --driver-memory command line option or in your default properties file.
- `spark.executor.memory` - 1g - Amount of memory to use per executor process, in the same format as JVM memory strings with a size unit suffix ("k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytse or "t" for terabytes) (e.g. 512m, 2g).
- `spark.executor.cores` - 1 - in YARN mode, all the available cores on the worker in standalone and Mesos coarse-grained modes. The number of cores to use on each executor. In standalone and Mesos coarse-grained modes, for more detail, see this description.

* the erason why you get out of memory errors in your script is because even though you are yes not using broadcast joins or collecting the results from each executor/worker you are implicitly collecting the results in a list and then concnatenating these resultant tables into one big table thus overwhelming the driver in the spark cluster. 

- Accumulation of Data: As you process more data and generate more of these lists of lists of DataFrames, the memory consumption on the driver grows proportionally to the total size of the data contained within all those DataFrames.
- Large Concatenation Operation: When you finally perform the concatenation of all these DataFrames at once (using pd.concat() if you're bringing them to the driver as Pandas DataFrames, or even Spark's union() if you're keeping them as Spark DataFrames but performing the union on the driver), the driver needs to hold the entire combined dataset in its memory before writing it to Parquet. This is exactly the "one big table" scenario you mentioned.
- Driver Memory Limits: The Spark driver has a finite amount of memory allocated to it (controlled by the spark.driver.memory configuration). If the total size of the data you are accumulating and then trying to concatenate exceeds this limit, the driver will run out of memory and throw an OOM error.

What you could do is either do iterative saving processing the data in chunks as a Spark DataFrame and saving it to a separate Parquet file. You can then read all these Parquet files later for further analysis. This avoids accumulating everything in the driver's memory. Another is by increasing the Driver Memory (as a last resort and with caution). While increasing `spark.driver.memory` might temporarily alleviate the issue for moderately larger datasets, it's not a sustainable long-term solution for truly large-scale data. It also makes your driver a potential bottleneck and point of failure. It's generally better to address the underlying data processing pattern.

a solution could be is to save the dataframe of each state of specific year ranges. Since there are 51 states 24 years this would be
(10 * 51) + (10 * 51) + (4 * 51) = 1224 dataframes all in all

* `=COUNTIF(<range of cells>, "*")` actually counts cells given range of cells that are not empty strings 

* finally found the complete population data with all age years, sex, ethnicity, and origin at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/research/evaluation-estimates/2010-evaluation-estimates.html, https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-detail.html, and https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-detail.html

only thing left to do is to preprocess these csv's again with spark

* if we have 24 gb of installed ram and 23 gb usable and have 8 cores in our CPU we can utilize this memory to partition it across all 8 cores of our cpu for concurrent processing in spark. We need to also take note of background processes in our task manager taking up our memory so if need be we have to end these background processes that take up too much memory in order to free up space for our spark driver memory and spark executor memory 

* so doing the following in spark isn't good for the driver memory since it is what collects all executors processed dataframes. And if we try and concatenate all our dataframes without sufficient memory for the driver it will result in an out of memory error whereas if we can partition our memory with our executors and save it instead by chunks then we can avoid this error

* if we ever get the ff. error when we jsut merely create a dataframe and show it e.g. `strat_perms_df = session.createDataFrame(strat_perms, ["Sex", "Ethnicity", "Origin"]) strat_perms_df.show()` then it means according to this post **https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77369508/python-worker-keeps-on-crashing-in-pyspark** that our installed python that spark uses may not be compatible with it, this was the case when I had python `3.12.6` installed but when I downgraded to `3.11.5` or `3.11.8` or any other `3.11.x` version accordin the the post then the `EOF exception` disappears

* `<groupid>:<artifactid>:<release version>` e.g. `com.google.guava:guava:33.4.8-jre` which whne translated to `.xml` is...
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
    <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
    <version>23.6-jre</version>
</dependency> 
```

example 2: 
`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.0` that we include during spark submit in `.xml` is 
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
    <artifactId>hadoop-aws</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

* to specify multiple packages in spark-submit the list of packages should be separated using commas without whitespaces (breaking lines should work just fine) for instance: `spark-submit --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.0,com.google.guava:guava:23.6-jre test_s3.py`

* reading csv files from s3 requires many packages 
- `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.0` this is the right version
- `com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.11.563` tried version 1.12.367
- `org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:4.4.16`
- `com.google.guava:guava:33.4.0-jre` tried version 33.4.0-jre, 27.0-jre, 33.3.1-jre, 33.3.0-jre
 
- the maven package `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.0` when we read the packages compile dependencies requires `com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.11.563` so it makes sense to also include this in our spark submit

* solved the java no such method error com google common base preconditions by installing guava 27.0-jre version since by default spark 3.5.5 uses guava 14 which does not have the common base preconditions check argument methodas the error says but guava 27 does and so installing this is what is required to sovle the above problem. All in all thhe command would be `spark-submit --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.0,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.11.563,com.google.guava:guava:27.0-jre test_s3.py`. Or we can go to the location where we installed spark directly and in it go to its jars folder and locate the outdated guava jar, remove it, download the updated guava jar file at `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/27.0-jre/` and place it inside the jars folder in the root spark directory. We can omit the com.google.guava:guava:27.0-jre package as it will be included in the jars folder in our root spark directory, as a matter of fact we can download and add all these packages manually and move it all to the root spark directory so we don't haev to explicitly specify these packages anymore during our `spark-submit` and be downloaded over and over.

* to install aws cli run `msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi` or download the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) at `https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi`

* always take note if you are assigning the right value to the `fs.s3a.access.key` and `fs.s3a.secret.key` keys as even interchanging your IAM user credentials will result in `The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records` error. 

* another error `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.hadoop.util.SemaphoredDelegatingExecutor.<init>` when writing parquet file to aws s3 via spark. using `hadoop-aws 3.2.2` might work. Solved since spark is 3.5.5, hadoop.dll and winutils.exe under hadoop 3.3.0, and jdk 17, version of compatible external jars for these versions are hadoop-aws 3.3.4, aws-java-sdk-bundle 1.11.563, and guava 27.0,

* another error `Class org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.auth.IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider not found` may occur during spark-submit, which occurs mainly because of the external jar hadoop-aws package not being of a compatible version. This must be the same version or above the hadoop version our spark environment uses, in this case our hadoop had winutils.exe and hadoop.dll be under hadoop version 3.3.0 this means that when we spark-submit our hadoop-aws external jar package must also be 3.3.0 and above (note that 3.3.4 already works in order to avoid the above SemaphoredDelegatingExecutor when writing parquet to s3 using spark)

* Permissions: The error could be related to permissions. If your IAM policies or bucket policies have changed, or if the object's ACL has been modified, you might receive a NoSuchKey error instead of an Access Denied error. This is because S3 doesn't always distinguish between non-existent objects and objects you don't have permission to access.
```
cdi_url = "s3://chronic-disease-analyses-bucket/cdi-data-transformed/CDI.parquet/"
cdi_url

# note that if we only specify a string instead of a list in read_parquet it must be enclosed in a quote or double quotes
query = f"""
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE CDI AS
    SELECT *
    FROM read_parquet('{cdi_url}', union_by_name=True, filename=False)
"""

duckdb.sql(query)
```

but the reason the above code could not work before is because we are reading a folder with the partitioned files inside since it was after all done by spark. The way we could read this in DuckDB is to use a glob expression `*` that reads anything and in particular `*.parquet` which reads anything ending in a `.parquet` file and then unionizing these parquet files by column name. So we have to actually read an object or a file in s3 which we can achieve by using `*.parquet`, in order to actually load the parquet files we have just dumped to s3 in OLAP DBs like DuckDB. So our url would be instead `"s3://chronic-disease-analyses-bucket/cdi-data-transformed/CDI.parquet/*.parquet"`

* `IOException: IO Error: Could not establish connection error for HTTP HEAD to 'https://chronic-disease-analyses-bucket/cdi-data-transformed/CDI.parquet/'` with status 1096710176. Is solved by adding `ENDPOINT` key to creating a `SECRETS` object in duckdb e.g. 
```
duckdb.sql(f"""
    CREATE SECRET (
        TYPE s3,
        KEY_ID '{credentials["aws_access_key_id"]}',
        SECRET '{credentials["aws_secret_access_key"]}',
        REGION '{credentials["region_name"]}',
        ENDPOINT 's3.{credentials["region_name"]}.amazonaws.com'
    );
""")
```

* in order to use duckdb in powerbi we have to use its cloud based version motherduck which requires us to now create a motherduck account and then create an access token at https://app.motherduck.com/settings/tokens in order to connect to the data
```
con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), dbdir = "quack.duckdb", read_only = FALSE)

My expectation would be an error with the second attempt, because duckdb only allows one write connection to avoid conflicts.

It used to give you the The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. error posted above, but now in v0.10.1 it doesn't error (or give a warning) at all.
```

* solving powerbi `Error: File is already open in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftPowerBIDesktop_2.142.1277.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\bin\Microsoft.Mashup.Container.NetFX45.exe` error: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-r/issues/56

* There are three ways in which DAX formulas and expressions can be written in Power BI:
- Calculated Tables - These calculations will add an additional table to the report based on a formula. 
- Calculated Columns - These calculations will add an additional column to a table based on a formula. These columns are treated like any other field in the table. 
- Measures - These calculations will add a summary or aggregated measure to a table based on a formula.

To add any one of these types of calculations to a model, navigate to the Modeling tab of the ribbon. Here, you will find three choices for adding a new measure, calculated column, or table.

So dito siya by clicking a table loaded in powerbi > going to ribbon and selecting table tools > selecting either new measure, new column, or new table. A measure basically calculates a scalar or single value from a column/s or table/s i.e. aggregating column A, aggregating column B and then combining these aggregated values to a single value

* if we wanted to create a new table based on a DAX expression we would select a table temporarily > go to ribbon > create new table > in the bar we can expand it to write a longer query i.e.

```
TestTable = ADDCOLUMNS(
	SUMMARIZE(
		'chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   Population',
		'chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   Population'[StateID],
		'chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   Population'[Year],
		"TotalStatePopulation", SUM('chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   Population'[Population])
	),
	"State", LOOKUPVALUE(
		'chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   PopulationState'[State],
		'chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   PopulationState'[StateID],
		'chronic_disease_analyses_db   main   Population'[StateID]
	)
)
```

* In DAX, measures the output as always is a single, scalar value (e.g., a total sum, an average, a count, a percentage). It also automatically adapts its calculation based on the filters applied by slicers, rows in a table visual, columns in a bar chart, etc. Recall that a slicer from the list of visualizers powerbi has to offer is like a fully functional GUI for a WHERE clause in SQL, where we can filter our data in our tables to pick what unique data we want

* you can fitler the table based on its columns to view only rows you want, but does not reflect the operation on the table itself. Just go to table view > select column > click down arrow next to it > select the unique values you only want to view 

* to use a map in powerbi that uses a gradient map we need to go to settings and

* to publish report to powerbi services we go to home in ribbon and click publish, sign in with our microsoft email, then choose our workspace, 

* go to file tab in workspace under your published report > embed report > publish to web. This will provide you with the `iframe` html element which embeds your published report which you can use in any html web page, or web app like react or svelte. But since this is only a dashboard a simple html file will do. We create one named index in our current projects directory in our local machine, then go to vercel and add new project. There will be no used preset to use for this deployment like svelte, react, etc. but only other, or no preset. Vercel will automatically detect the html we want to render through its file name, named `index` we just need to specify in our deployment settings where this file lives. Once deployed we will see our dashboard publicly.

* we can actually get the median, mode, kurtosis, entropy with DuckDB's built in functions

## Spark Optimization   
* Say I have 24 gb ram installed and 16 gb is currently usable because of other background processes and I have 8 cores in the CPU. Rule is to leave out 1 gb and 1 core for hadoop distributed file system processes and OS daemon processes during spark submissions. So we would have 15 gb and 7 cores to work with

When we define executors e.g. 1 then 15 gb and 7 would have to be divided by 1 since these spaces and cores will be used by an executor so it will be 15 gb and 7 cores to be used by one executor still

When we want 5 executors our cores will have to be partitioned across all these executors and sicne the num of execs is an odd number some executors will have unequal amount of cores compared to other executors. In this case 15 gb and 7 both divided by 5 will yield 5 executors each having 1 1 1 2 and 2 cores respectively and 3 3 3 3 and 3 gb memory respectively. 

Notice how our number of executors will always depend on the number of cores in our cpu, in that **we can always add any number of executors so long as we still have cores available but we cannot add any more number of cores than the amount our cpu has just because we want more executors**. 

Thin executor with 15 gb memory and 7 cores means each executor uses 1 core at the most and 1 gb memory at the most resulting in 7 executors using only 1 core and each having only 1 gb memory. Notice again that our number of executors will always depend on the number of cores as these courses cores are distributed evenly across these executors and if there are more executors than there is cores to distribute then it is a violation of this rule

* Spark physical plan. Physical plan is read bottom to up. Catalyst optimizer is divided into 3 parts which is what precede the physical plan of spark. 3 arts are unresolved/unoptimized logical plan and catalog (if data exists in the first place), logical plan, optimized logical plan respectively
